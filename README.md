# HONDA KA NA BA!?
A team game I created from my past employer for a Bi-monthly huddle.

This is inspired from a Filipino game show called Game K N B, using Cars to advance in Race Track when the team gets the answer right. 

Each team have the priveledge to use their power ups for their advantage. They may boost themselves with nitros, reverse an enemy team or maybe call a police upon an enemy...
